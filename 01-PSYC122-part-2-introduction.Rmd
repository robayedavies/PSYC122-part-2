# PSYC122 Part 2 Week 16

Welcome to our overview of the materials and activities you will work with in **PSYC122 Week 16**.
You will see -- below -- links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities.
All the links in this document are *live*: click on them and they will take you to the webpage.
All the links to the different materials and activities are also in the **Check list** for Week 16 on Moodle, here:

<https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/checklist/view.php?id=1510231>

Everything you need for a practical class is in the **Week 16 files** folder on Moodle, here:

## Lectures: video recordings

The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts.

[Part 1 of 3](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1a7c6e5e-3b8e-4084-af23-acc80117761c){target="_blank"})

[Part 2 of 3](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3463e56f-d1ee-41a3-b347-acc80120e181){target="_blank"})

[Part 3 of 3](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d88a1a07-50cb-4382-8a3e-acc8013582e3>){target="_blank"})

## Readings

We do not provide further reading but you may find it helpful to take another look at the readings provided, previously, for your classes in weeks 11-13.

## Pre-lab activity

In weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.
Completing the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.
In the classes, we can then analyze the data we collect to test our predictions about what makes it difficult or easy to understand health advice.

To enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.
You can complete the survey here (just click on the web address to get started):

<https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9HX4wSBz3s1uIuO>

The survey asks you to:

- complete some questions about who you are;
- and then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.

The survey then asks you to:

- read five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;
- respond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;
- and rate how well you think you understand the advice.

The survey should take 15-20 minutes to complete.
Some people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time.
We think 15-20 minutes is about right.
**Please do not spend longer on the survey than 20 minutes.**

Taking part in the survey is completely voluntary.
You can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it.
If you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).

**All** responses will be recorded completely anonymously.

## Pre-lab alternative activity

If you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.
The plan was registered here:

<https://osf.io/9j58g/>

The document is linked to the *Open Science Framework* repository for the project.
The project information can be found here:

<https://osf.io/pxdtb/>

There is not much there right now.
When we have finished data collection for the project, we will post the **completely anonymous** data file here.

## Lab activities

### Objectives

In Week 16, we aim to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Consolidate learning on data visualization:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Use histograms to examine the distributions of variables
\item
Use boxplots to examine the differences between groups on a variable
\item
Use scatterplots to examine how values on one variable relate to values on another variable
\end{itemize}
\item
Develop learning in how we use data from previous studies to make predictions about future results (our 2021 \emph{PSYC122 COVID-19 project} results)
\end{enumerate}

### Explanation of the activity exercises

When we plan research, we need to make specific predictions about what we expect to find.
Often, we can make these predictions by looking at the results from similar studies done previously.

When we make predictions, we need to consider:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The shape or character of the effect we expect to observe: will one group have a higher score on average than another? will we see a positive or a negative association between two variables?
\item
The size or the impact of the effect we expect: will we see a large difference or a small difference? will the slope of the effect of the association be steep or shallow?
\end{itemize}

It helps to make the judgments about what we expect if we draw plots to *visualize* the relationships or the differences we are expected in.
Later, when we look at the results for our 2021 project, we can check if the relationships or differences we expected are matched by those we see in our data.

### Lab activity: Data and .R files

In the lab activity .R file **122-week-16-lab-activity.R**, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics):

- **general-2021-02-09.csv**

The data are similar in format to the COVID-19 data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project.

The activity .R file and the data .csv file can be found here:

<https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1510232>

### How-to guide: Data and .R files

Every coding action we ask you to do in the lab activity .R file can be revised in the **How-to** guide.
The **How-to** guide shows you how to read in the data file and draw the plots using the same kind of code that you will need to use to complete the activity.

The **How-to** guide .R code was written to work with data from a 2020 national UK study about how people respond to guidance about COVID-19:

- **covid-2021-02-09.csv**

The data are similar in format to the COVID-19 data we are collecting now as part of the PSYC122 project.

<!-- ```{r data-image-covid-2021-02-09, echo=FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.cap="Extract view of COVID-19 (2020 study) data .csv file"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("data-image-covid-2021-02-09.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

The **How-to** guide .R file and this data .csv file can be found here:

<https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1510232>

### Explanation of the data files

Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.
You can see there are columns:

- `PROLIFIC.ID` participant code
- `mean.acc` average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance
- `mean.self` average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance
- `age` age in years
- `HLVA` health literacy score
- `gender` gender code
- `EDUCATION` education level code
- `ETHNICITY` ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code
- `education` education simplified coding
- `ethnicity` ethnicity simplified coding
