# PSYC122 Part 2 Week 19

## Welcome

Welcome to your overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in **PSYC122 Week 19**.

We will complete four classes in weeks 16-19.
These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC122, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.

We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the **Clearly understood** project.
Our focus will be on **what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information**.
In these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions:

1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?
2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?

We will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes.
And we will be extending your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.

I have said that, ultimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together.
**That time is now.**
The PSYC122 health comprehension survey is now closed, and we will focus the activity in our work in practical classes on analyzing the data we have collected.

The results of our analyses of these new data will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future.

## Our learning goals

In Week 19, we aim to use our skills in visualizing *and* in analyzing psychological data to answer our research questions:

1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?
2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?

We will use linear models to estimate the association between predictors and outcomes.

What is new, here, is firstly that:

- we will fit linear models including *multiple* predictors, this is why this form of analysis is also often called "multiple regression"

Secondly, we will compare the results from different studies to critically examine questions relating to *results reproducibility*:

- do we see the same results when similar methods are used to collect data to address the same questions?

As we work, we will develop skills in producing appealing plots for professional audiences.
And, as we work, we will also practise how we can ensure that the code we write to do data analysis is reproducible, and shareable.
This is about open science good practice.
And it is about getting ready for professional team working.

## Resources for you

You will see -- below -- links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities.

All the links to the lectures, and everything you need for your practical work class can *also* be found under the **Week 19 resources** section title, on Moodle:

### What's in the lectures

The lectures have three main areas of focus.

#### Scientific thinking

We shall proceed to answer our research questions with the data we have collected with the help of PSYC122 students.
As we do this, we should reflect on where the data come from -- the choices made on data collection -- and we should consider, critically, questions concerning key ideas:

- **Methods reproducibility** -- Will a different researcher be able to get the same results if they analyze the same data?
- **Results reproducibility** -- Will we get the same results if we collect new data using the same procedure?

These questions are part of our motivation for recommending open science practices.

#### Working with the linear model with multiple predictors

We focus in-depth on how you code linear models, how you identify critical information in the results summaries, and how you report the results: the language and the style you can use in your reports.

#### The implications of our results, the revolution in open science and being part of it

Last, we set up questions for you to consider:

- What are the results of our analyses with the new data?
- What are the implications for health communication?

Then we step back, and consider how we are learning to work in terms of the modern workflow, and the on-going revolution in open science, and how people now build and share knowledge.

## Readings

We do not provide further reading but you may find it helpful to take another look at the readings provided, previously, for your PSYC122 classes in weeks 11-13, and in weeks 16-18.

## Pre-lab activity 1

In weeks 16-19, we have been working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.
Completing the project involved collecting responses from PSYC122 students.
In our class activities, this week, we will analyze the data we collected up to Monday 7th. March.

The link to the survey is here, for your information:

[Link to survey](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0ww8HHxx172TPJs){target="_blank"}

**The survey is now officially closed.**

Also or your information, you can read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project, here:

[Link to project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/){target="_blank"}

Looking at the survey or at the pre-registration are entirely optional activities.

## Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class

### Get your files ready

Download the [122_week19_forStudents.zip](files/week-19/122_week19_forStudents.zip) files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server.

The folder includes data files:

- `study-one-general-participants.csv`
- `study-two-general-participants.csv`
- `PSYC122-2022.csv`

and code files:

- `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-activity.R`
- `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R`

You will use `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-activity.R` in the lab activity practical class.

### Review the how-to guide

We show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (see the next section) in the `how-to` guide.

The guide comprises an .R file `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R` with code and advice, and a video showing you how the code works.
The code in the .R file was written to work with the data files:

- `study-one-general-participants.csv`
- `study-two-general-participants.csv`.

In the video, I work my way through the R code, step-by-step, explaining what each line of code does.
Watching the video takes about 35 minutes.
This is a bit longer than usual because I wanted to explain more comprehensively some extra things like how you can export plots to create images that you can then use in your reports.

Watching the how-to guide video is completely optional but I have provided the video because students have told us they find it useful.

[Watch the how-to guide](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=a727d5a5-72ea-486f-ada4-ae55010c2058){target="_blank"}

Note that I have worked to ensure that all the critical information you need to use the how-to guide is presented in the comments, and you can read the comments at your own speed.

## Lab activity -- we will work with new data based on the responses of PSYC122 students

In the lab activity .R file `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-activity.R`, we will work with the response data we collected from PSYC122 students this term.

- `PSYC122-2022.csv`

We will compare these new data with data collected in a previous, related, study on how people respond to guidance about health topics (general topics):

- `study-one-general-participants.csv`

The data are similar in format though there are some minor differences, explained in the activity or the how-to R file comments.

The activity .R file and the data .csv files can be downloaded from:

[122_week19_forStudents.zip](files/week-19/122_week19_forStudents.zip)

Or you can download it from the module Moodle page for PSYC122, the **Week 19 resources** section:

[Link to Moodle](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=35319#section-9){target="_blank"}

### What is in the activity .R file?

We will take things step-by-step.
We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions:  

The activity tasks are designed to build skills in key data analysis and visualization methods, and to further develop the process of using statistical tests (like the linear model) to address the **Clearly understood** research questions.

### Tasks

In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.

1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`
2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`
3. Read in the data files -- using `read_csv()`
4. Inspect the data -- using `head()` and `summary()`
5. Visualize the distribution of values -- using `geom_histogram()`
6. Create a grid of plots, so you can compare distributions from two datasets at the same time
7. Visualize the potential association between the values of two variables -- using `geom_point()`
7. Create a grid of scatterplots, so you can compare the potential association between the same pair of variables in two datasets
8. Create boxplots to examine the potential association between variation in a continuous outcome variable and the differences between groups or levels in a categorical variable -- using `geom_boxplot()`
9. Estimate the way in which an outcome may vary, given different values in a predictor variable -- using  `lm()`
10. Do this with multiple predictor variables
10. Compare the results from analyses of data from similar studies: do results replicate?
11. Visualize the model predictions -- using `ggpredict()`
12. Optional -- export plots as images you can use in your reports.

The activity `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-activity.R` file takes you through the tasks, one by one.

If you are unsure about what you need to do, check in the `how-to` guide: look at the advice in `2021-22-PSYC122-w19-how-to.R` or watch the accompanying video.

You will see that you can match a task in the `activity` to the same task in the `how-to`.
The `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.
You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.

This process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science.

### What is in the data files

Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.
```{r head}
head(study.one.general)
```

You can see the columns:

- `participant_ID` participant code
- `mean.acc` average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance
- `mean.self` average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance
- `study` varianble coding for what study the data were collected in
- `AGE` age in years
- `HLVA` health literacy test score
- `SHIPLEY` vocabulary knowledge test score
- `FACTOR3` reading strategy survey score
- `GENDER` gender code
- `EDUCATION` education level code
- `ETHNICITY` ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code
