# Introduction

Welcome to our overview of the materials and activities you will work with in **PSYC122 Part 2**.

We will complete a series of four classes which will run in weeks 16-19.
The classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.
