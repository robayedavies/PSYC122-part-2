We will complete four classes in weeks 16-19. These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124. We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts. Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information. We encounter written health information all the time: in COVID warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about. It is not always easy to understand this information. The problem is that it is unclear how health information should be communicated. As psychologists, we can help to improve health communication. In these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions: What person attributes predict success in understanding? Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information? We will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this context will help you to make sense of the data, and to see why we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching. We will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. This is to give you the opportunity to revise and consolidate your learning. We will be extending your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills. Ultimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together. These new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future. 2.2 Our learning goals In Week 16, we will ask you to do two things. First, we will ask you to do a pre-lab activity that involves completing a survey. Completing the survey will help you to make sense of the numbers you will be working with in the activities. Completing the pre-lab activity will help to teach you about the challenges of measurement, a key aspect of the scientific thinking skills we will help you grow: Scientific thinking: from concerns to questions to results and critical evaluation Second, we wil ask you to do a set of practical tasks in the lab activity that are designed to consolidate your learning on data visualization. We will focus on the visualization of data distributions. We will be: Using histograms to examine the distributions of variables; And learning to edit the histograms so they are more effective. 2.3 Resources for you You will see – below – links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities. All the links to the different materials and activities are also in the Check list for Week 16 on Moodle, here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/checklist/view.php?id=1510231 Everything you need for a practical class can also be found in the Week 16 files folder on Moodle, here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=31548#section-6 2.4 Lectures: video recordings The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts. Part 1 of 3 Part 2 of 3 Part 3 of 3 2.5 Readings We do not provide further reading but you may find it helpful to take another look at the readings provided, previously, for your classes in weeks 11-13. 2.6 Pre-lab activity 1 In weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice. Completing the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students. In our class activities, we can then analyze the data we collect. To enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey. You can complete the survey here (just click on the web address to get started): https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9HX4wSBz3s1uIuO The survey asks you to: complete some questions about who you are; and then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading. The survey then asks you to: read five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue; respond to some multiple choice questions about each extract; and rate how well you think you understand the advice. The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. Some people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time. Taking part in the survey is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it. If you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below). All responses will be recorded completely anonymously. 2.7 Pre-lab activity 1 alternative If you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the PSYC122 health advice research project. The plan was registered here: https://osf.io/9j58g/ The document is linked to the Open Science Framework repository for the project. The project information can be found here: https://osf.io/pxdtb/ There is not much there right now. When we have finished data collection for the project, we will post the completely anonymous data file here. 2.8 Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class 2.8.1 Get your files ready Download the 122_week16_forStudents.zip folder and upload it to RStudio Server. 2.8.2 Review the how-to guide We show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (see the next section) in the how-to guide. The guide includes an .R file 2021-22-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R with code and advice, and a video showing you how the code works. The code in the .R file was written to work with the data file study-one-general-participants.csv. You can find both the 2021-22-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R and the study-one-general-participants.csv files in the 122_week16_forStudents.zip folder. 2.9 Lab activity In the lab activity .R file 2021-22-PSYC122-w16-activity.R, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics): study-two-general-participants.csv The data are similar in format to the response data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project. The activity .R file and the data .csv file can be found here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1510232 2.9.1 What is in the activity .R file We will take things step-by-step. We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions: different parts for different phases of the analysis workflow; different tasks for different steps in each phase; different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps. 2.9.2 Tasks In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks. Empty the R environment – using rm(list=ls()) Load relevant libraries – using library() Read in the data file – using read_csv() Inspect the data – using head() and summary() Change the type classification of a variable in the data – using as.factor() Draw histograms to examine the distributions of variables – using ggplot() and geom_histogram() Edit the appearance of one variable histogram plot step-by-step The activity 2021-22-PSYC122-w16-activity.R file takes you through the tasks, one by one. If you are unsure about what you need to do, check in the how-to guide: look at the advice in 2021-22-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R or watch the accompanying video. You will see that you can match a task in the activity to the same task in the how-to. The how-to shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code. You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity. This process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science. 2.9.3 What is in the data files Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure. head(study.two.gen) ## # A tibble: 6 x 12 ## participant_ID mean.acc mean.self study AGE SHIPLEY HLVA FACTOR3 QRITOTAL ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 studytwo.1 0.411 6.07 studyt… 26 27 6 50 9 ## 2 studytwo.10 0.607 8.5 studyt… 38 24 9 58 15 ## 3 studytwo.100 0.875 8.93 studyt… 66 40 13 60 20 ## 4 studytwo.101 0.964 8.5 studyt… 21 31 11 59 14 ## 5 studytwo.102 0.714 7.07 studyt… 74 35 7 52 18 ## 6 studytwo.103 0.768 5.07 studyt… 18 40 11 54 15 ## # … with 3 more variables: GENDER &lt;chr&gt;, EDUCATION &lt;chr&gt;, ETHNICITY &lt;chr&gt; You can see the columns: participant_ID participant code mean.acc average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance mean.self average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance study varianble coding for what study the data were collected in AGE age in years HLVA health literacy test score SHIPLEY vocabulary knowledge test score FACTOR3 reading strategy survey score GENDER gender code EDUCATION education level code ETHNICITY ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code "]]
