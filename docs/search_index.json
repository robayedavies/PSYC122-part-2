We will complete a series of four classes in weeks 16-19. The classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124. We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts. Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information. This research is needed because it is important to ensure that health advice can be understood but existing evidence can tell us little about how advice should be written so that everyone who reads the advice can understand it. We will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this will help you to make sense of the data, and of what we ask you to do. We will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. This is to give you the opportunity to revise and consolidate your learning. And we will be extending your development with some new ideas. Ultimately, our aim will be to contribute new findings from data we collect with your help. These new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future. 2.1 Our learning goals In Week 16, we aim to further develop your skills in working with psychological data. We will learn how to answer research questions like: What person attributes predict success in understanding? Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information? These kinds of research questions can be answered using methods like correlation and linear models. In Week 16, we will consolidate learning on data visualization: Using histograms to examine the distributions of variables; Learning to edit the histograms so they are more effective. You will see – below – links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities. All the links in this document are live: click on them and they will take you to the webpage. All the links to the different materials and activities are also in the Check list for Week 16 on Moodle, here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/checklist/view.php?id=1510231 Everything you need for a practical class can also be found in the Week 16 files folder on Moodle, here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=31548#section-6 2.2 Lectures: video recordings The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts. Part 1 of 3 Part 2 of 3 Part 3 of 3 2.3 Readings We do not provide further reading but you may find it helpful to take another look at the readings provided, previously, for your classes in weeks 11-13. 2.4 Pre-lab activity In weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice. Completing the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students. In the classes, we can then analyze the data we collect. To enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey. You can complete the survey here (just click on the web address to get started): https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9HX4wSBz3s1uIuO The survey asks you to: complete some questions about who you are; and then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading. The survey then asks you to: read five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue; respond to some multiple choice questions about each extract; and rate how well you think you understand the advice. The survey should take 15-20 minutes to complete. Some people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time. We think 15-20 minutes is about right. Please do not spend longer on the survey than 20 minutes. Taking part in the survey is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it. If you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below). All responses will be recorded completely anonymously. 2.5 Pre-lab alternative activity If you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the PSYC122 health advice research project. The plan was registered here: https://osf.io/9j58g/ The document is linked to the Open Science Framework repository for the project. The project information can be found here: https://osf.io/pxdtb/ There is not much there right now. When we have finished data collection for the project, we will post the completely anonymous data file here. 2.6 Lab activities 2.6.1 Objectives In Week 16, we aim to: 2.6.2 Explanation of the activity exercises When we plan research, we need to make specific predictions about what we expect to find. Often, we can make these predictions by looking at the results from similar studies done previously. When we make predictions, we need to consider: It helps to make the judgments about what we expect if we draw plots to visualize the relationships or the differences we are expected in. Later, when we look at the results for our 2021 project, we can check if the relationships or differences we expected are matched by those we see in our data. 2.6.3 Lab activity: Data and .R files In the lab activity .R file 122-week-16-lab-activity.R, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics): general-2021-02-09.csv The data are similar in format to the COVID-19 data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project. The activity .R file and the data .csv file can be found here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1510232 2.6.4 How-to guide: Data and .R files Every coding action we ask you to do in the lab activity .R file can be revised in the How-to guide. The How-to guide shows you how to read in the data file and draw the plots using the same kind of code that you will need to use to complete the activity. The How-to guide .R code was written to work with data from a 2020 national UK study about how people respond to guidance about COVID-19: covid-2021-02-09.csv The data are similar in format to the COVID-19 data we are collecting now as part of the PSYC122 project. The How-to guide .R file and this data .csv file can be found here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1510232 2.6.5 Explanation of the data files Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure. You can see there are columns: PROLIFIC.ID participant code mean.acc average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance mean.self average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance age age in years HLVA health literacy score gender gender code EDUCATION education level code ETHNICITY ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code education education simplified coding ethnicity ethnicity simplified coding "]]
