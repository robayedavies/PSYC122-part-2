We will complete four classes in weeks 16-19. These classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124. We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the Clearly understood project. Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information. In these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions: What person attributes predict success in understanding? Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information? We will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes. And we will be extending your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills. Ultimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together. These new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future. 3.2 Our learning goals In Week 17, we will ask you to do two things. 3.3 Resources for you You will see – below – links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities. All the links to the lectures, and everything you need for your practical work class can also be found under the Week 17 resources section title, on Moodle: Link to Moodle 3.4 Lectures: video recordings The lecture material for this week is presented in three parts. Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part. (You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.) Part 1 of 3 Part 2 of 3 Part 3 of 3 3.5 Readings We do not provide further reading but you may find it helpful to take another look at the readings provided, previously, for your classes in weeks 11-13. 3.6 Pre-lab activity 1 In weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice. Completing the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students. In our class activities, we can then analyze the data we collect. To enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey. You can complete the survey here if you have not already done so: Complete the survey If you have done this once, do not do it again. 3.6.1 Survey information The survey asks you to: complete some questions about who you are; and then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading. The survey then asks you to: read five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue; respond to some multiple choice questions about each extract; and rate how well you think you understand the advice. The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. Some people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time. Taking part in the survey is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it. If you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below). All responses will be recorded completely anonymously. 3.7 Pre-lab activity 1 alternative If you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the PSYC122 health advice research project. Read the project pre-registration 3.8 Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class 3.8.1 Get your files ready Download the 122_week17_forStudents.zip files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server. The folder includes data files: study-one-general-participants.csv study-two-general-participants.csv and code files: 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-activity.R 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R You will use 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-activity.R in the lab activity practical class. 3.8.2 Review the how-to guide We show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (see the next section) in the how-to guide. The guide comprises an .R file 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R with code and advice, and a video showing you how the code works. The code in the .R file was written to work with the data file study-one-general-participants.csv. In the video, I work my way through the R code, step-by-step, explaining what each line of code does. Watching the video takes about 20 minutes. It is completely optional but I have provided the video because students have told us they find it useful. Watch the how-to guide 3.9 Lab activity In the lab activity .R file 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-activity.R, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics): study-two-general-participants.csv The data are similar in format to the response data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project. The activity .R file and the data .csv file can be downloaded from: 122_week17_forStudents.zip Or you can download it from the module Moodle page for PSYC122, the Week 17 resources section: Link to Moodle 3.9.1 What is in the activity .R file? We will take things step-by-step. We will split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions: different parts for different phases of the analysis workflow; different tasks for different steps in each phase; different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps. 3.9.2 Tasks In the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks. Empty the R environment – using rm(list=ls()) Load relevant libraries – using library() Read in the data file – using read_csv() Inspect the data – using head() and summary() Create basic scatterplots – using ggplot() and geom_point() Edit the appearance of plots – using alpha, size, theme_bw() and labs() Edit the appearance of plots – using xlim() and ylim() Draw histograms to examine the distributions of variables – using ggplot() and geom_histogram() Edit the appearance of one variable histogram plot step-by-step Test a correlation using cor.test() The activity 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-activity.R file takes you through the tasks, one by one. If you are unsure about what you need to do, check in the how-to guide: look at the advice in 2021-22-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R or watch the accompanying video. You will see that you can match a task in the activity to the same task in the how-to. The how-to shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code. You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity. This process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science. 3.9.3 What is in the data files Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure. head(study.two.gen) ## # A tibble: 6 x 12 ## participant_ID mean.acc mean.self study AGE SHIPLEY HLVA FACTOR3 QRITOTAL ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 studytwo.1 0.411 6.07 studyt… 26 27 6 50 9 ## 2 studytwo.10 0.607 8.5 studyt… 38 24 9 58 15 ## 3 studytwo.100 0.875 8.93 studyt… 66 40 13 60 20 ## 4 studytwo.101 0.964 8.5 studyt… 21 31 11 59 14 ## 5 studytwo.102 0.714 7.07 studyt… 74 35 7 52 18 ## 6 studytwo.103 0.768 5.07 studyt… 18 40 11 54 15 ## # … with 3 more variables: GENDER &lt;chr&gt;, EDUCATION &lt;chr&gt;, ETHNICITY &lt;chr&gt; You can see the columns: participant_ID participant code mean.acc average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance mean.self average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance study varianble coding for what study the data were collected in AGE age in years HLVA health literacy test score SHIPLEY vocabulary knowledge test score FACTOR3 reading strategy survey score GENDER gender code EDUCATION education level code ETHNICITY ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code "]]
